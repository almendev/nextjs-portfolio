                Biography
              </h2>
              <p className="font-medium">
                Hi there! My name is Alfredo MÃ©ndez, and I was born in Valencia,
                Venezuela. As far as I can remember, I&apos;ve always been
                interested in technology, which led me to become a
                telecommunications engineer in 2012.
              </p>
              <p className="font-medium my-4">
                During my career, I learned about the science behind things that
                we take for granted today, such as sending a message, making a
                call, or browsing the internet. I also wrote my first lines of
                code in languages such as Pascal, C, and C++, which ignited my
                love and curiosity for programming.
              </p>
              <p className="font-medium">
                Since then, I have worked in various areas in both large and
                small companies in two different countries. While I have learned
                a lot from these experiences, I wasn&apos;t as close to
                technology as I would have liked, so it was time for a change.
              </p>
              <p className="font-medium my-4">
                Today, I live in Portugal and dedicate myself entirely to web
                development. I found it to be the most visual and satisfactory
                way for me to solve problems by applying technology and
                creativity. Through my work, I continue to explore the
                ever-evolving landscape of technology, always seeking new ways
                to apply my skills and creativity to make a meaningful
                contribution to the tech industry and to society as a whole.
